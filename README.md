## PCB ordering

-   [Ordering](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/WLED_wemos_shield.html) - $5 for 10 PCBs very good quality.
-   [Sign in and save](https://www.pcbway.com/setinvite.aspx?inviteid=83580) - Helping me to save some money for development.
```
Wi-Fi LED controller with following features
```
-   Very easy to configure for your needs;
-   Easy to solder components;
-   Level shifter for relaible signal;
-   Power selector (e.g 5VDC or 12VDC);
-   Can be configured for 3 wire and 4 wire addressable LED strips;
-   Analog input for sound reactive compatability;
-   Button options (depend on type of addressable LED strip);
-   Relay for power saving feature (without disconnecting power from LED strip it still consuming mA per LED even if none of LEDs is lit);
-   Added I2C connector for OLED display or other devices that might be integrated in a feature;
-   Optional Dallas temperature sensor.
